## Welcome to Get Fit!

Get Fit is a fitness-tracking app to help with the difficulty of delayed gratification! We all know it's hard to stick to a workout schedule or a diet, but why? Humans are terrible at reasoning when it comes to delayed gratification, we always want everything now!! That's why I built this web app--to help tie long-term fitness goals to near-term rewards! Keep track of your diet and exercise and earn points towards short-term goals! It might take you a while to reach your ultimate goal, but you'll have fun along the way, and hopefully Get Fit will make it just a bit easier to not eat that tempting donut!
