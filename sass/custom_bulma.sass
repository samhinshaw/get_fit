// 1. Import the first half of the utilities
@import "bulma/sass/utilities/initial-variables"

// 2. Do stuff
// Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out how to make this work through the proper method of import, customize, import the rest. SO, I manually edited 'utilities/derived-variables' and 'utilities/variables'. Hopefully in the future I'll figure out why this wasn't working properly. 

// 3. Import the rest of Bulma
@import "bulma/bulma"
